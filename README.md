# @statecharts-experiments

This repository hosts a couple of utils I find myself using in my journey to master xstate. I hope it will be useful for you too !

## Dev

This is a lerna monorepo powered by yarn workspaces

To start developing:

```
yarn lerna bootstrap
yarn lerna run start --parallel
```
